# Pig Game 🎲

Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a simple JavaScript-based game where two players compete to reach a score of 100 first. But beware, if you roll a 1 on the dice, you lose your current score and it's the next player's turn.

## How to Play 🕹️

1. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice. The number you roll will be added to your current score.
2. If you're satisfied with your current score, click the "Hold" button to add it to your total score.
3. Be careful! If you roll a 1, your current score will reset to 0 and it will be the next player's turn.
4. The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more wins the game!

## Game Features 💡

- **Dynamic UI**: The player's scores and current scores are updated dynamically on the screen.
- **Winner Announcement**: Once a player reaches a total score of 100 or more, they are declared the winner.
